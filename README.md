  provider.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Databricks Integration, [deploy the integration](#on-host)
using a supported deployment type, [configure](#configuration) the integration
using supported configuration mechanisms, and optionally
[import](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#import-json)
the sample dashboards included in the [examples](./examples/) directory.

### On-host

The Databricks Integration can be deployed inside a Databricks cluster on the
cluster's driver node (recommended) or outside a Databricks cluster on a
supported host platform.

**NOTE:**

* [Apache Spark data](#apache-spark-data) for a Databricks [cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
  cannot be collected remotely. In order to collect [Apache Spark data](#apache-spark-data)
  from a Databricks cluster, the Databricks Integration _must_ be deployed
  inside the cluster.
* The Databricks Integration can be used separately from Databricks to solely
  collect [Apache Spark data](#apache-spark-data) from any accessible Spark
  deployment.

#### Deploy the integration on the driver node of a Databricks cluster

The Databricks Integration can be deployed on the driver node of a Databricks
all-purpose, job, or pipeline [cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
using a [cluster-scoped init script](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/cluster-scoped.html).
The [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) uses custom
[environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/configure#environment-variables)
to specify configuration parameters necessary for the integration [configuration](#configuration).

To install the [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) on an
all-purpose cluster, perform the following steps.

1. Login to your Databricks account and navigate to the desired
   [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
1. Follow the [recommendations for init scripts](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/index.html#recommendations-for-init-scripts)
   to store the [`cluster_init_integration.sh`](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh)
   script within your workspace in the recommended manner. For example, if your
   workspace is [enabled for Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html#step-1-confirm-that-your-workspace-is-enabled-for-unity-catalog),
   you should store the init script in a [Unity Catalog volume](https://docs.databricks.com/en/ingestion/file-upload/upload-to-volume.html).
1. Navigate to the [`Compute`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#view-compute)
   tab and select the desired all-purpose compute to open the compute details
   UI.
1. Click the button labeled `Edit` to [edit the compute's configuration](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#edit-a-compute).
1. Follow the steps to [use the UI to configure a cluster-scoped init script](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/cluster-scoped.html#configure-a-cluster-scoped-init-script-using-the-ui)
   and point to the location where you stored the init script in step 2 above.
1. If your cluster is not running, click on the button labeled `Confirm` to
   save your changes. Then, restart the cluster. If your cluster is already
   running, click on the button labeled `Confirm and restart` to save your
   changes and restart the cluster.

Additionally, follow the steps to [set environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#environment-variables)
to add the following environment variables.

* `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` - Your [New Relic User API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-key)

   of your New Relic account; one of `US` or `EU`
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_HOST` - The [instance name](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids)
   of the target Databricks instance
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_ACCESS_TOKEN` - To [authenticate](#authentication) with
   a [personal access token](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users),
   your personal access token
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - To [use a service principal to authenticate with Databricks (OAuth M2M)](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html),
   the OAuth client ID for the service principal
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - To [use a service principal to authenticate with Databricks (OAuth M2M)](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html),
   an OAuth client secret associated with the service principal
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_USAGE_ENABLED` - Set to `true` to enable collection of
  [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data) from this cluster node or
  `false` to disable collection. Defaults to `true`.
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_SQL_WAREHOUSE` - The ID of a [SQL warehouse](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/sql-warehouse/index.html)
   where usage queries should be run
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_JOB_RUNS_ENABLED` - Set to `true` to enable collection
  of [job run data](#job-run-data) from this cluster node or `false` to disable
  collection. Defaults to `true`.
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_PIPELINE_EVENT_LOGS_ENABLED` - Set to `true` to enable
  collection of Databricks Delta Live Tables [pipeline event logs](#pipeline-event-logs)
  from this cluster node or `false` to disable collection. Defaults to `true`.
* `NEW_RELIC_DATABRICKS_QUERY_METRICS_ENABLED` - Set to `true` to enable
  collection of Databricks [query metrics](#query-metrics) for this workspace
  or `false` to disable collection. Defaults to `true`.
* `NEW_RELIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENABLED` - Set to `true` to install the
  [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/introduction-infra-monitoring/)
  on the driver and worker nodes of the [cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster).
  Defaults to `false`.
* `NEW_RELIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_LOGS_ENABLED` - Set to `true` to enable collection
  of the Spark driver and executor logs, the Spark driver event log, and the
  driver and worker init script logs. Logs will be [forwarded](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/)
  to [New Relic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management/)
  via the [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/introduction-infra-monitoring/)
  and therefore, setting this environment variable to `true` requires that the
  `NEW_RELIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENABLED` environment variable also be set to `true`.
  Defaults to `false`.

**NOTE:**
* The `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` and `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID` are currently unused but
  are required by the [new-relic-client-go](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-client-go)
  module used by the integration.
* Only the personal access token _or_ OAuth credentials need to be specified but
  not both. If both are specified, the OAuth credentials take precedence.
* Sensitive data like credentials and API keys should never be specified
  directly in custom [environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/configure#environment-variables).
  Instead, it is recommended to create a [secret](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html)
  using the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/index.html)
  and [reference the secret in the environment variable](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/secrets/secrets-spark-conf-env-var#reference-a-secret-in-an-environment-variable).
  See the [appendix](#appendix) for an [example](#example-creating-and-using-a-secret-for-your-new-relic-license-key)
  of creating a [secret](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html)
  and referencing it in a custom [environment variable](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/configure#environment-variables).
* To install the [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) on a job
  cluster, see the section [configure compute for jobs](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/jobs/compute)
  in the Databricks documentation.
* To install the [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) on a pipeline
  cluster, see the section [configure compute for a DLT pipeline](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dlt/configure-compute)
  in the Databricks documentation.
* Make sure to restart the cluster following the configuration of the
  environment variables.

#### Deploy the integration on a host outside a Databricks cluster

The Databricks Integration provides binaries for the following host platforms.

* Linux amd64
* Windows amd64

To run the Databricks integration on a host outside a Databricks cluster,
perform the following steps.

1. Download the appropriate archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-databricks-integration/releases/latest).
1. Extract the archive to a new or existing directory.
1. Create a directory named `configs` in the same directory.
1. Create a file named `config.yml` in the `configs` directory and copy the
   contents of the file [`configs/config.template.yml`](./configs/config.template.yml)
   in this repository into it.
1. Edit the `config.yml` file to [configure](#configuration) the integration
   appropriately for your environment.
1. From the directory where the archive was extracted, execute the integration
   binary using the command `./newrelic-databricks-integration` (or
   `.\newrelic-databricks-integration.exe` on Windows) with the appropriate
   [Command Line Options](#command-line-options).

## Features

The Databricks Integration supports the following capabilities.

* Collect Spark telemetry

  When deployed [inside a Databricks cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-the-driver-node-of-a-databricks-cluster),
  the Databricks Integration can collect telemetry from all Spark applications
  running in the cluster.

  When deployed [outside a Databricks cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-a-host-outside-a-databricks-cluster),
  the Databricks Integration can also collect Spark telemetry from all Spark
  applications on any accessible Spark deployment.

* Collect Databricks consumption and cost data

  The Databricks Integration can collect consumption and cost related
  data from the Databricks [system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html).
  This data can be used to show Databricks DBU consumption metrics and estimated
  Databricks costs directly within New Relic.

* Collect Databricks job run telemetry

  The Databricks Integration can collect telemetry about
  [Databricks Job](https://docs.databricks.com/en/jobs/index.html#what-are-databricks-jobs)
  runs, such as job run durations, task run durations, the current state of job
  and task runs, if a job or a task is a retry, and the number of times a task
  was retried.

* Collect Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs

  The Databricks Integration can collect [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
  for all [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/develop-pipelines.html)
  defined in a [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
  [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
  entries for every [pipeline update](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/updates.html)
  are collected and sent to [New Relic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management/).

###### Databricks Usage `enabled`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of consumption and cost data | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data).

This flag can be used to disable the collection of consumption and cost data by
the Databricks collector. This may be useful when running multiple instances of
the Databricks Integration. In this scenario, Databricks consumption and cost
data collection should _only_ be enabled on a single instance. Otherwise, this
data will be recorded more than once in New Relic, affecting consumption and
cost calculations.

###### `warehouseId`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ID of a SQL warehouse on which to run usage-related SQL statements | string | Y | N/a |

The ID of a SQL warehouse on which to run the SQL statements used to collect
Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data).

This parameter is required when the collection of Databricks
[consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data) is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled).

###### `includeIdentityMetadata`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable inclusion of identity related metadata in consumption and cost data | `true` / `false` | N | `false` |

When the collection of Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data)
is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled), the Databricks collector can include
several pieces of identifying information along with the consumption and cost
data.

By default, when the collection of Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data)
is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled), the Databricks collector will _not_
collect such data as it may be personally identifiable. This flag can be used to
enable the inclusion of the identifying information.

When enabled, the following values are included.

* The identity of the user a serverless billing record is attributed to. This
  value is included in the [identity metadata](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html#analyze-identity-metadata)
  returned from usage records in the [billable usage system table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html).
* The identity of the cluster creator for each usage record for billable usage
  attributed to all-purpose and job compute.
* The single user name for each usage record for billable usage attributed to
  all-purpose and job compute configured for [single-user access mode](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#access-mode).

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time of day (as `HH:mm:ss`) at which to run usage data collection | string with format `HH:mm:ss` | N | `02:00:00` |

This parameter specifies the time of day at which the collection of
[consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data) occur. The value must be of
the form `HH:mm:ss` where `HH` is the `0`-padded 24-hour clock hour
(`00` - `23`), `mm` is the `0`-padded minute (`00` - `59`) and `ss` is the
`0`-padded second (`00` - `59`). For example, `09:00:00` is the time 9:00 AM and
`23:30:00` is the time 11:30 PM.

The time will _always_ be interpreted according to the UTC time zone. The time
zone can not be configured. For example, to specify that the integration should
be run at 2:00 AM EST (-0500), the value `07:00:00` should be specified.

###### `optionalQueries`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The root node for the set of flags used to selectively enable or disable optional usage queries | YAML Mapping | N | N/a |

When the collection of Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data)
is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled), the Databricks collector will always
collect [billable usage data](#billable-usage-data) and [list pricing data](#list-pricing-data)
on every run. In addition, by default, the Databricks collector will also run
all [job cost](#job-costs) queries on every run. However, the latter behavior
can be configured using a set of flags specified with this configuration
property to selectively enable or disable the [job cost](#job-costs) queries.
Each flag is specified using a property with the query ID as the name of the
property and `true` or `false` as the value of the property.The following flags
are supported.

* [`jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job_run`](#list-cost-per-job-run)
* [`jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job`](#list-cost-per-job)
* [`jobs_cost_frequent_failures`](#list-cost-of-failed-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-failures)
* [`jobs_cost_most_retries`](#list-cost-of-repaired-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-repairs)

For example, to enable the [list cost per job run](#list-cost-per-job-run) query
and the [list cost per job](#list-cost-per-job) query but disable the
[list cost of failed job runs for jobs with frequent failures](#list-cost-of-failed-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-failures) query
and the [list cost of repaired job runs for jobs with frequent repairs](#list-cost-of-repaired-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-repairs) query,
the following configuration would be specified.

```yaml
  optionalQueries:
    jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job_run: true
    jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job: true
    jobs_cost_frequent_failures: false
    jobs_cost_most_retries: false
```

##### Databricks Job configuration

##### Databricks job run configuration

The Databricks job run configuration parameters are used to configure Databricks
collector settings related to the collection of Databricks [job run data](#job-run-data).

###### Databricks job runs `enabled`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of job run data | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect [job run data](#job-run-data).

This flag can be used to disable the collection of job run data by the
Databricks collector. This may be useful when running multiple instances of the
Databricks Integration against the same Databricks [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
In this scenario, Databricks job run data collection should _only_ be enabled on
a single instance of the integration. Otherwise, this data will be recorded more
than once in New Relic, affecting product features that use [job run metrics](#job-run-metrics)
(e.g. [dashboards](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/)
and [alerts](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/overview/)).

###### Databricks job run `metricPrefix`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A prefix to prepend to Databricks [job run metric](#job-run-metrics) names | string | N | N/a |

This parameter specifies a prefix that will be prepended to each Databricks
[job run metric](#job-run-metrics) name when the metric is exported to New
Relic.

For example, if this parameter is set to `databricks.`, then the full name of
the metric representing the duration of a job run (`job.run.duration`) will be
`databricks.job.run.duration`.

Note that it is not recommended to leave this value empty as the metric names
without a prefix may be ambiguous.

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable inclusion of the job run ID in the `databricksJobRunId` attribute on all [job run metrics](#job-run-metrics) | `true` / `false` | N | `false` |

By default, the Databricks collector will not include job run IDs on any of the
[job run metrics](#job-run-metrics) in order to avoid possible violations of
[metric cardinality limits](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/convert-to-metrics/creating-metric-rules-requirements-tips/#attributes-limit)
due to the fact that job run IDs have high cardinality because they are unique
across all jobs and job runs.

This flag can be used to enable the inclusion of the job run ID in the
`databricksJobRunId` attribute on all job metrics.

When enabled, use the [Limits UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/#limits-ui)
and/or create a [dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#create-a-dashboard-to-view-your-limit-status)
in order to monitor your limit status. Additionally, [set alerts on resource metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#set-alerts-on-resource-metrics)
to provide updates on limits changes.

###### `startOffset`

| Flag to enable inclusion of the task run ID in the `databricksJobRunTaskRunId` attribute for Spark job, stage, and task metrics associated with Databricks job runs | `true` / `false` | N | `false` |

By default, the Spark collector will not include task run IDs on any of the
Spark job, stage, and task metrics associated with Databricks job runs in order
to avoid possible violations of [metric cardinality limits](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/convert-to-metrics/creating-metric-rules-requirements-tips/#attributes-limit)
due to the fact that task run IDs have high cardinality because they are unique
across all job task runs.

This flag can be used to enable the inclusion of the task run ID in the
`databricksJobRunTaskRunId` attribute on all Spark job, stage, and task metrics
associated with Databricks job runs.

When enabled, use the [Limits UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/#limits-ui)
and/or create a [dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#create-a-dashboard-to-view-your-limit-status)

By default, the Spark collector will not include pipeline update IDs on any of
the Spark job, stage, and task metrics associated with Databricks pipeline
updates in order to avoid possible violations of [metric cardinality limits](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/convert-to-metrics/creating-metric-rules-requirements-tips/#attributes-limit)
due to the fact that pipeline update IDs have high cardinality because they are
unique across all pipeline updates.

This flag can be used to enable the inclusion of the pipeline update ID in the
`databricksPipelineUpdateId` attribute on all Spark job, stage, and task metrics
associated with Databricks pipeline updates.

When enabled, use the [Limits UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/#limits-ui)
and/or create a [dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#create-a-dashboard-to-view-your-limit-status)
in order to monitor your limit status. Additionally, [set alerts on resource metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#set-alerts-on-resource-metrics)
to provide updates on limits changes.

### Authentication

The Databricks integration uses the [Databricks SDK for Go](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-go.html)
to access the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction).
The SDK performs authentication on behalf of the integration and provides many
options for configuring the authentication type and credentials to be used. See
the [SDK documentation](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication)
and the [Databricks client unified authentication documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/unified-auth.html)
for details.

For convenience purposes, the following parameters can be used in the
[Databricks configuration](#databricks-configuration) section of the
[`config.yml](#configyml) file.

- [`accessToken`](#accesstoken) - When set, the integration will instruct the
  SDK to explicitly use [Databricks personal access token authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html).
  The SDK will _not_ attempt to try other authentication mechanisms and instead
  will fail immediately if personal access token authentication fails.
- [`oauthClientId`](#oauthclientid) - When set, the integration will instruct
  the SDK to explicitly [use a service principal to authenticate with Databricks (OAuth M2M)](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).
  The SDK will _not_ attempt to try other authentication mechanisms and instead
  will fail immediately if OAuth M2M authentication fails. The OAuth Client
  secret can be set using the [`oauthClientSecret`](#oauthclientsecret)
  configuration parameter or any of the other mechanisms supported by the SDK
  (e.g. the `client_secret` field in a Databricks [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/config-profiles.html)
  or the `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable).
- [`oauthClientSecret`](#oauthclientsecret) - The OAuth client secret to use for
  [OAuth M2M authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).
  This value is _only_ used when [`oauthClientId`](#oauthclientid) is set in the
  [`config.yml`](#configyml). The OAuth client secret can also be set using any
  of the other mechanisms supported by the SDK (e.g. the `client_secret` field
  in a Databricks [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/config-profiles.html)
  or the `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable).

**NOTE:** Authentication applies only to calls made to collect Databricks
telemetry via the [Databricks SDK for Go](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-go.html).
The Spark collector does not support authentication when accessing the
[Spark ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.2/monitoring.html#rest-api).

### Apache Spark Data

The Databricks Integration can collect [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html)
[application](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html)
metrics for all running applications in a given [Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/cluster-overview.html).
Metrics are collected by accessing the monitoring [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
through the [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html) of a
given [`SparkContext`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/rdd-programming-guide.html#initializing-spark).

This feature can be used for _any_ [Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/cluster-overview.html),
not just for Spark running on Databricks.

When the Spark collector is enabled (the top-level [`spark`](#spark) node is
specified), Spark application metrics are collected from the [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html)
URL specified in the [`webUiUrl`](#webuiurl) or from the [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html)
URL `https://localhost:4040` by default.

#### Spark Application Metric Data

Spark application telemetry is sent to New Relic as [dimensional metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics).
The provided metrics and attributes (dimensions) are listed in the sections
below.

**NOTE:** Many of the descriptions below are sourced from the
Apache Spark monitoring [ReST API documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api).

##### Spark application metric types

The Apache Spark monitoring [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
returns two types of metrics: monotonically increasing counters (referred to
below simply as "counters") and gauges, with the majority of metrics being
counters.

While all gauge metrics returned from the [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
are created as gauge metrics within New Relic, note that all counter metrics
returned from the [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
are also created as gauge metrics. While the `latest()`, `min()`, `max()`,
`sum()`, `count()`, and `average()` [NRQL aggregator functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#aggregator-functions)
are all therefore available for use with these metrics, only [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
will provide meaningful results (e.g. taking the average of a set of data points
that represent a monotonically increasing counter makes no sense).

Therefore, in general, only the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function should be used when visualizing or alerting on metrics
listed in the sections below with the metric type `counter`.

Further to this, even when using the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function, the metrics have no meaning without an identifying `FACET`.

As an example, to show the total number of completed tasks by executor ID, use
the query `SELECT latest(app.executor.completedTasks) FROM Metric FACET sparkAppName, sparkAppExecutorId`
and not `SELECT count(app.executor.completedTasks) FROM Metric FACET sparkAppName, sparkAppExecutorId`.
Using `count()` on a gauge metric accesses the `count` field of the metric which
in this case is always `1` even though the metric being represented is a
counter. The counter value is actually in the `latest` field of the metric.
Further, using the metric _without_ faceting by the executor ID will only return
the latest `app.executor.completedTasks` metric in the selected time window and
ignore any other instances of that metric in the same time window.

##### Spark job, stage, and task status

Most of the Spark metrics recorded include at least one of the following
attributes that indicate the [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) of the
job, stage, or task for the metric.

* `sparkAppJobStatus`

  Spark job [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status). One of the following.

  * `running` - job is executing
  * `lost` - job status is unknown
  * `succeeded` - job completed successfully
  * `failed` - job failed

* `sparkAppStageStatus`

  Spark stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status). One of the following.

  * `active` - stage is executing

  * `skipped` - task was skipped because the stage was skipped
  * `failed` - task failed
  * `killed` - task was explicitly killed

##### Spark job, stage, and task counts

On each run, for each Spark application, the integration records the following
counter metrics.

* `app.jobs`

  The number of Spark jobs for an application by job [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status).
  This metric will always include the `sparkAppJobStatus` attribute, which
  indicates which job [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) the metric
  applies to (for instance, if the metric value is 5 and the `sparkAppJobStatus`
  attribute is `running`, it means that there are 5 running jobs).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` to target a specific application or to
  group the values by application.

* `app.stages`

  The number of Spark stages for an application by stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status).
  This metric will always include the `sparkAppStageStatus` attribute, which
  indicates which stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) the metric
  applies to (for instance, if the metric value is 5 and the
  `sparkAppStageStatus` attribute is `complete`, it means that there are 5
  completed stages).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` attributes to target a specific
  application or to group the values by application.

* `app.job.stages`

  The number of Spark stages for a Spark job by stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status).
  This metric will always include the `sparkAppStageStatus` and
  `sparkAppJobStatus` attributes, which indicate which stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status)
  and job [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) the metric applies to,
  respectively (for instance, if the metric value is 2 and
  the `sparkAppStageStatus` attribute is `complete` and the `sparkAppJobStatus`
  is `running`, it means that the job is running and 2 stages have completed).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` attributes to target a specific
  application or to group the values by application and the `sparkAppJobId`
  attribute to target a specific job or to group the values by job.

* `app.job.tasks`

  The number of Spark tasks for a Spark job by task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status).
  This metric will always include the `sparkAppTaskStatus` and
  `sparkAppJobStatus` attributes, which indicate which task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status)
  and job [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) the metric applies to,
  respectively (for instance, if the metric value is 4 and
  the `sparkAppTaskStatus` attribute is `complete` and the `sparkAppJobStatus`
  is `running`, it means that the job is running and 4 tasks have completed).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` attributes to target a specific
  application or to group the values by application and the `sparkAppJobId`
  attribute to target a specific job or to group the values by job.

* `app.stage.tasks`

  The number of Spark tasks for a Spark stage by task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status).
  This metric will always include the `sparkAppTaskStatus` and
  `sparkAppStageStatus` attributes, which indicate which task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status)
  and stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) the metric applies to,
  respectively (for instance, if the metric value is 4 and the
  `sparkAppTaskStatus` attribute is `complete` and the `sparkAppStageStatus`
  is `active`, it means that the stage is running and 4 tasks have completed).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` attributes to target a specific
  application or to group the values by application and the `sparkAppStageId` or
  `sparkAppStageName` attribute to target a specific stage or to group the
  values by stage.

In general, only the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function should be used when visualizing or alerting using these
counters.

##### Mapping Spark metrics to Databricks Jobs and Pipelines

When the Databricks Integration is deployed on the [driver node of a Databricks cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-the-driver-node-of-a-databricks-cluster),
all Spark metrics collected from Spark running on Databricks compute will have
the following attributes.

| Name                     | Data Type | Data Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `databricksWorspaceId`   | string    | The Databricks workspace [ID](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids)            |
| `databricksWorspaceName` | string    | The Databricks workspace [instance name](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids) |
| `databricksWorspaceUrl`  | string    | The Databricks workspace [URL](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids)           |

Additionally, the integration will attempt to map Spark job, stage, and task
metrics to either a Databricks Job task run or a Databricks Pipeline (and in
some cases a specific update flow). This is done by examining the `jobGroup`
field that is returned for Spark jobs on the [Spark ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api).

By default, the value of the `jobGroup` field is a string with a specific
format that includes the Databricks job ID and task run ID for Spark job, stage,
and task metrics associated with a Databricks job run, and includes the
Databricks pipeline ID (and in some cases the pipeline update ID and pipeline
update flow ID) for Spark job, stage, and task metrics associated with a
Databricks pipeline update.

When collecting Spark job, stage, and task metrics, the Databricks integration
will examine the value of the `jobGroup` field. If the value follows one of the
recognized formats, the integration will parse the IDs out of the field and
include the IDs as attributes on each Spark job, stage, and task metric as
follows.

* For Spark job, stage, and task metrics associated with a Databricks job task
  run, the following attributes are added.

  | Name                        | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
  | --------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `databricksJobId`           | number    | The job ID for the associated Databricks job run                                                                                                               |
  | `databricksJobRunTaskRunId` | number    | The task run ID for the associated Databricks job run (only included if [`includeJobRunTaskRunId`](#spark-databricks-includejobruntaskrunid) is set to `true`) |

* For Spark job, stage, and task metrics associated with a Databricks pipeline
  update, the following attributes are added.

  | Name                         | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
  | ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `databricksPipelineId`       | string    | The pipeline ID for the associated Databricks pipeline                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
  | `databricksPipelineUpdateId` | string    | The pipeline update ID for the associated Databricks pipeline update (only included if the pipeline update ID is present in the `jobGroup` field and [`includePipelineUpdateId`](#spark-databricks-includepipelineupdateid) is set to `true`)                       |
  | `databricksPipelineFlowId`   | string    | The pipeline update flow ID for the flow in the associated Databricks pipeline update (only included if the pipeline update flow ID is present in the `jobGroup` field and  [`databricksPipelindFlowId`](#spark-databricks-includepipelineflowid) is set to `true`) |

If the value of the `jobGroup` field does _not_ follow one of the recognized
formats (for example, if the `jobGroup` has been customized using the
[`setJobGroup`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.SparkContext.setJobGroup.html)
function), the field value will not be parsed and none of the additional
attributes will be available on the associated Spark job, stage and task
metrics. Only the workspace related attributes will be available.

### Consumption & Cost Data

The Databricks Integration can collect Databricks consumption and cost related
data from the Databricks [system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html).
This data can be used to show Databricks DBU consumption metrics and estimated
Databricks costs directly within New Relic.

This feature is enabled by setting the [Databricks usage `enabled`](#databricks-usage-enabled)
flag to `true` in the [integration configuration](#configuration). When enabled,
the Databricks collector will collect consumption and cost related data once a
day at the time specified in the [`runTime`](#runtime) configuration parameter.
The following information is collected on each run.

* Billable usage records from the [`system.billing.usage` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html)
* List pricing records from the [`system.billing.list_prices` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html)
* List cost per job run of jobs run on jobs compute and serverless compute
* List cost per job of jobs run on jobs compute and serverless compute
* List cost of failed job runs for jobs with frequent failures run on jobs
  compute and serverless compute
* List cost of repair job runs for jobs with frequent repairs run on jobs
  compute and serverless compute

**NOTE:** Job cost data from jobs run on workspaces outside the region of the
workspace containing the SQL Warehouse used to collect the consumption data
(specified in the [`workspaceHost`](#workspacehost) configuration parameter)
will not be returned by the queries used by the Databricks integration to
collect Job cost data.

#### Consumption and Cost Collection Requirements

In order for the Databricks Integration to collect consumption and cost related
data from Databricks, there are several requirements.

1. The SQL [warehouse ID](#warehouseid) of a [SQL warehouse](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/sql-warehouse/index.html)
   within the workspace associated with the configured [workspace host](#workspacehost)
   must be specified. The Databricks SQL queries used to collect consumption and
   cost related data from the Databricks [system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html).
   will be run against the specified SQL warehouse.
1. As of v2.6.0, the Databricks integration leverages data that is stored in the
   `system.lakeflow.jobs` table. As of 10/24/2024, this table is in public
   preview. To access this table, the `lakeflow` schema must be enabled in your
   `system` catalog. To enable the `lakeflow` schema, follow the instructions in
   the Databricks documentation to [enable a system schema](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html#enable-a-system-schema)
   using the metastore ID of the [Unity Catalog metastore](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html#metastores)
   attached to the workspace associated with the configured [workspace host](#workspacehost)
   and the schema name `lakeflow`.

#### Billable Usage Data

On each run, billable usage data is collected from the [`system.billing.usage` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html)
_for the previous day_. For each billable usage record, a corresponding record
is created within New Relic as a [New Relic event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data)

#### List Pricing Data

On each run, list pricing data is collected from the [`system.billing.list_prices` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html)
and used to populate a [New Relic lookup table](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/lookup-tables-ui/)
named `DatabricksListPrices`. The entire lookup table is updated on each run.
For each pricing record, this table will contain a corresponding row with the
following columns.

**NOTE:** Descriptions below are sourced from the
[pricing system table reference](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html).

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `account_id` | ID of the account this pricing record was generated for |

| `usage_unit` | The unit of measurement that is monetized in this pricing record |
| `list_price` | A single price that can be used for simple long-term estimates |

Note that the `list_price` field contains a single price suitable for simple
long-term estimates. It does not reflect any promotional pricing or custom price
plans.

#### Job Costs

On each run, the Databricks collector runs a set of queries that leverage data
in the [`system.billing.usage` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html),
the [`system.billing.list_prices` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html),
and the [`system.lakeflow.jobs` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/jobs.html)
to collect job cost related data _for the previous day_. The set of queries that
are run collect the following data.

* [List cost per job run](#list-cost-per-job-run) of jobs run on jobs compute
  and serverless compute
* [List cost per job](#list-cost-per-job) of jobs run on jobs compute and
  serverless compute
* [List cost of failed job runs for jobs with frequent failures](#list-cost-of-failed-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-failures)
  run on jobs compute and serverless compute
* [List cost of repaired job runs for jobs with frequent repairs](#list-cost-of-repaired-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-repairs)
  run on jobs compute and serverless compute

By default, the Databricks integration runs each query on every run. This
behavior can be configured using the [`optionalQueries`](#optionalqueries)
configuration parameter to selectively enable or disable queries by query ID.

For each query that is run, a [New Relic event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data)
with the event type `DatabricksJobCost` is created for each result row with one
attribute for each column of data. In addition, each event includes a `query_id`
attribute that contains the unique ID of the query that produced the data stored
in the event. This ID can be used in [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/)
queries to scope the query to the appropriate data set.

See the following sub-sections for more details on the data sets collected by
each query.

**NOTE:** Please see the note at the end of the [Consumption & Cost Data](#consumption--cost-data)
section regarding job cost data and the last requirement in the
[Consumption and Cost Requirements](#consumption-and-cost-collection-requirements)
section for important considerations for collecting job cost data.

### Job Run Data

The Databricks Integration can collect telemetry about [Databricks Job](https://docs.databricks.com/en/jobs/index.html#what-are-databricks-jobs)
runs, such as job run durations, task run durations, the current state of job
and task runs, if a job or a task is a retry, and the number of times a task was
retried. This feature is enabled by default and can be enabled or disabled using
the [Databricks jobs `enabled`](#databricks-job-runs-enabled) flag in the
[integration configuration](#configuration).

**NOTE:** Some of the text below is sourced from the
[Databricks SDK Go module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go@v0.46.0).

#### `startOffset` Configuration

On each run, the integration uses the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
to retrieve job run data. By default, the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
endpoint for [listing job runs](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
returns a paginated list of _all_ historical job runs sorted in descending order
by start time. On systems with many jobs, there may be a large number of job
runs to retrieve and process, impacting the performance of the collector. To
account for this, the integration provides the [`startOffset`](#startoffset)
configuration parameter. This parameter is used to tune the performance of the
integration by constraining the start time of job runs to match to be greater
than a particular time in the past calculated as an offset from the current time
and thus, limiting the number of job runs to return.

The effect of this behavior is that only job runs which have a start time _at_
or _after_ the calculated start time will be returned on the API call. For
example, using the default [`startOffset`](#startoffset) (86400 seconds or 24
hours), only job runs which started within the last 24 hours will be returned.
This means that jobs that started more than 24 hours ago will not be returned
_even if_ some of those jobs are not yet in a `TERMINATED` [state](#job-and-task-run-states).
Therefore, it is important to carefully select a value for the [`startOffset`](#startoffset)
parameter that will account for long-running job runs without degrading the
performance of the integration.

#### Job Run Metric Data

Job run data is sent to New Relic as [dimensional metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics).
The following metrics and attributes (dimensions) are provided.

##### Job run metrics

##### Job and task run states

Databricks job and task runs can be in one of 6 states.

* `BLOCKED` - run is blocked on an upstream dependency
* `PENDING` - run is waiting to be executed while the cluster and execution
   context are being prepared
* `QUEUED` - run is queued due to concurrency limits
* `RUNNING` - run is executing
* `TERMINATING` - run has completed, and the cluster and execution context are
   being cleaned up
* `TERMINATED` - run has completed

The job and run task states are recorded in the `databricksJobRunState` and
`databricksJobRunTaskState`, respectively. The `databricksJobRunState` is on
every [job run metric](#job-run-metrics) including the task related metrics. The
`databricksJobRunTaskState` is only on [job run metrics](#job-run-metrics)
related to tasks, e.g. `job.run.task.duration`.

##### Job and task run counts

On each run, the integration records the number of job and task runs in each
[state](#job-and-task-run-states) (with the exception of runs in the
`TERMINATED` state (see below)), in the metrics `job.runs` and `job.tasks`,
respectively, using the attributes `databricksJobRunState` and
`databricksJobRunTaskState`, to indicate the [state](#job-and-task-run-states).
In general, only the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function should be used when visualizing or alerting on counts
including these [states](#job-and-task-run-states). For example, to display the
number of jobs by state, use the following NRQL statement.

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT latest(databricks.job.runs)
FACET databricksJobRunState
```

The count of job and task runs in the `TERMINATED` state are also recorded but
only include job and task runs that have terminated _since the last run_ of the
integration. This is done to avoid counting terminated job and task runs more
than once, making it straightforward to use [aggregator functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#aggregator-functions)
to visualize or alert on values such as "number of job runs completed per time
period", "average duration of job runs", and "average duration job runs spent in
the queue". For example, to show the average time job runs spend in the queue,
grouped by job name, use the following NRQL statement.

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT average(databricks.job.run.duration.queue / 1000)
WHERE databricksJobRunState = 'TERMINATED'
FACET databricksJobRunName
LIMIT MAX
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to use the condition `databricksJobRunState = 'TERMINATED'`
or `databricksJobRunTaskState = 'TERMINATED'` when visualizing or alerting on
values using these [aggregator functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#aggregator-functions).

##### Job and task run durations

The Databricks integration stores job and task run durations in the metrics
`job.run.duration` and `job.run.task.duration`, respectively. The values stored
in these metrics are calculated differently, depending on the state of the job
or task, as follows.

* While a job or task run is running (not `BLOCKED` or `TERMINATED`), the run
  duration stored in the respective metrics is the "wall clock" time of the job
  or task run, calculated as the current time when the metric is collected by
  the integration minus the `start_time` of the job or task run as returned from
  the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction).
  This duration is *inclusive* of any time spent in the queue and any setup
  time, execution time, and cleanup time that has been spent up to the time the
  duration is calculated but does *not* include any time the job or task run was
  blocked.

  This duration is also cumulative, meaning that while the job run is running,
  the value calculated each time the integration runs will include the entire
  "wall clock" time since the reported `start_time`. It is essentially a
  [`cumulativeCount` metric](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/cumulative-metrics/)
  but stored as a `gauge`. Within [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/)
  statements, the [latest()](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
  function can be used to get the most recent duration. For example, to show the
  most recent duration of job runs that are running grouped by job name, use the
  following NRQL (assuming the job run [metricPrefix](#databricks-job-run-metricprefix)
  is `databricks.`).

  ```sql
  FROM Metric
  SELECT latest(databricks.job.run.duration)
  WHERE databricksJobRunState != 'TERMINATED'
  FACET databricksJobRunName
  ```

* Once a job or task run has been terminated, the run duration stored in the
  respective metrics are not calculated but instead come directly from the
  values returned in the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  (also see the SDK documentation for [`BaseRun`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go@v0.46.0/service/jobs#BaseRun)
  and [`RunTask`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go@v0.46.0/service/jobs#RunTask)).
  For both job and task runs, the run durations are determined as follows.

  * For job runs of multi-task jobs, the `job.run.duration` for a job run is set
    to the `run_duration` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
    field returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns).
  * For job runs of single-task jobs, the `job.run.duration` for a job run is
    set to the sum of the `setup_duration`, the `execution_duration` and the
    `cleanup_duration` fields of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
    field returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns).
  * For task runs, the `job.run.task.duration` for a task run is set to the sum
    of the `setup_duration`, the `execution_duration` and the `cleanup_duration`
    fields of the corresponding task run item in the `tasks` field of the
    corresponding job run item in the `runs` field returned from the
    [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns).

In addition to the `job.run.duration` and `job.run.task.duration` metrics, once
a job or task has terminated, the `job.run.duration.queue` and
`job.run.task.duration.queue` metrics are set to the `queue_duration` field of
the corresponding job run item in the `runs` field returned from the
[`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns) for
job runs, and the `queue_duration` field of the corresponding task run item in
the `tasks` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs` field from the
[`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns) for
task runs.

Finally, for job runs and task runs of _single-task jobs_, the following metrics
are set.

* The `job.run.duration.setup` and `job.run.task.duration.setup` metrics are set to the
  `setup_duration` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs` field
  returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)

### Pipeline Update Metrics

The Databricks Integration can collect telemetry about
[Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/develop-pipelines.html)
[updates](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/updates.html), such
as [flow](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta-live-tables/flows) durations,
[flow](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta-live-tables/flows) data quality
metrics, and [update](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/updates.html)
durations. This feature is enabled by default and can be enabled or disabled
using the [Databricks pipeline update metrics `enabled`](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-enabled)
flag in the [integration configuration](#configuration).

**NOTE:** Some of the text below is sourced from the
[Databricks Delta Live Tables pipeline event log schema documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-schema)
and the [Databricks SDK Go module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go).

#### Pipeline `startOffset` Configuration

On each run, the integration uses the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
to retrieve pipeline events for all [Delta Live Tables Pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/develop.html).
By default, the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
endpoint for [listing pipeline events](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/pipelines/listpipelineevents)
returns a paginated list of _all_ historical pipeline events sorted in
descending order by timestamp. On systems with many pipelines or complex
pipelines with many flows, there may be a large number of pipeline events to
retrieve and process, impacting the performance of the collector. To account for
this, the integration provides the [`startOffset`](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-startoffset)
configuration parameter. This parameter is used to tune the performance of the
integration by constraining the timestamp of pipeline events to match to be
greater than a particular time in the past calculated as an offset from the
current time and thus, limiting the number of pipeline events to return.

The effect of this behavior is that only pipeline events which have a timestamp
_at_ or _after_ the calculated start time will be returned on the API call. For
example, using the default [`startOffset`](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-startoffset)
(86400 seconds or 24 hours), only pipeline events which occurred within the last
24 hours will be returned. This means that pipeline events that occurred more
than 24 hours ago will not be returned _even if_ the associated pipeline update
is not yet complete. This can lead to missing flow or update metrics. Therefore,
it is important to carefully select a value for the [`startOffset`](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-startoffset)
parameter that will account for long-running pipeline updates without degrading
the performance of the integration.

#### Pipeline `intervalOffset` Configuration

The integration uses the [list pipeline events endpoint](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/pipelines/listpipelineevents)
of the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
to retrieve pipeline log events. There can be a slight lag time between when a
pipeline log event is emitted and when it is available in the [API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction).
The [`intervalOffset`](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-intervaloffset)
configuration parameter can be used to delay the processing of pipeline log
events in order to account for this lag. The default value for the
[`intervalOffset`](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-intervaloffset)
configuration parameter is 5 seconds.

To help illustrate, here is the processing behavior for the default settings
(60 second [collection interval](#interval) and 5 second [interval offset](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-intervaloffset)):

* on the first minute, the integration will process all pipeline log events from 60 seconds ago until 55 seconds ago
* on the second interval, the integration will process all pipeline log events from 55 seconds ago until 1:55
* on the third interval, the integration will process all pipeline log events from 1:55 until 2:55
* and so on

#### Pipeline Update Metric Data

##### Pipeline states

Databricks pipelines can be in one of nine states.

* `DELETED`
* `DEPLOYING`
* `FAILED`
* `IDLE`
* `RECOVERING`
* `RESETTING`
* `RUNNING`
* `STARTING`
* `STOPPING`

The pipeline state is recorded in the `databricksPipelineState` attribute on the
`pipeline.pipelines` metric only.

##### Pipeline update status

Databricks pipeline updates can have one of eleven statuses.

* `CANCELED`
* `COMPLETED`
* `CREATED`
* `FAILED`
* `INITIALIZING`
* `QUEUED`
* `RESETTING`
* `RUNNING`
* `SETTING_UP_TABLES`
* `STOPPING`
* `WAITING_FOR_RESOURCES`

The pipeline update status is recorded in the `databricksPipelineUpdateStatus`
attribute on the `pipeline.updates` metric and the `pipeline.update.*` metrics.

The statuses `CANCELED`, `COMPLETED`, and `FAILED` are considered update
termination statuses.

##### Pipeline flow status

Databricks pipeline flows can have one of ten statuses.

* `COMPLETED`
* `EXCLUDED`
* `FAILED`
* `IDLE`
* `PLANNING`
* `QUEUED`
* `RUNNING`
* `SKIPPED`
* `STARTING`
* `STOPPED`

The pipeline flow status is recorded in the `databricksPipelineFlowStatus`
attribute on the `pipeline.flows` metric and the `pipeline.flow.*`
metrics.

The statuses `COMPLETED`, `EXCLUDED`, `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, and `STOPPED` are
considered flow termination statuses.

##### Pipeline, update, and flow counts

On each run, the integration records the following counts.

* The count of all pipelines by [pipeline state](#pipeline-states) is recorded
  in the metric `pipeline.pipelines` using the attribute
  `databricksPipelineState` to indicate the [pipeline state](#pipeline-states).
* The count of all pipeline updates by [update status](#pipeline-update-status)
  is recorded in the metric `pipeline.updates` using the attribute
  `databricksPipelineUpdateStatus` to indicate the [update status](#pipeline-update-status).

  Pipeline updates with a termination [update status](#pipeline-update-status)
  (`CANCELED`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`) are only counted if the corresponding
  event occurred since the last run of the integration. Otherwise, these updates
  are ignored. This is done to avoid counting terminated updates more than once.

  Pipeline updates with a non-termination [update status](#pipeline-update-status)
  are always counted.
* The count of all pipeline flows by [flow status](#pipeline-flow-status) is
  recorded in the metric `pipeline.flows` using the attribute
  `databricksPipelineFlowStatus` to indicate the [flow status](#pipeline-flow-status).

  Pipeline flows with a termination [flow status](#pipeline-flow-status)
  (`COMPLETED`, `EXCLUDED`, `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, `STOPPED`) are only counted if
  the corresponding event occurred since the last run of the integration.
  Otherwise, these flows are ignored. This is done to avoid counting terminated
  flows more than once.

  Pipeline flows with a non-termination [flow status](#pipeline-flow-status)
  are always counted.

##### Pipeline update and flow durations

The Databricks integration records several update and flow durations. The
different durations and the ways in which they are calculated are as follows.

* `pipeline.update.duration`

  The `pipeline.update.duration` metric represents the total duration of the
  update from the time it is created until the time it terminates. After the
  update is created but before it terminates, the duration recorded in this
  metric is the "wall clock" time, calculated as the current time when the
  metric is recorded by the integration minus the timestamp of the pipeline log
  event where the update was created. Once the update terminates, the duration
  recorded in this metric is calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the
  pipeline log event where the update was created from the timestamp of the
  pipeline log event where the update reached the termination [status](#pipeline-update-status).

* `pipeline.update.duration.wait`

  The `pipeline.update.duration.wait` metric represents the amount of time the
  update spent waiting for resources (that is, while it has the
  `WAITING_FOR_RESOURCES` [update status](#pipeline-update-status)). While the
  update is waiting for resources, the duration recorded in this metric is the
  "wall clock" time, calculated as the current time when the metric is recorded
  by the integration minus the timestamp of the pipeline log event where the
  update reached the `WAITING_FOR_RESOURCES` [status](#pipeline-update-status).
  Once the update reaches the `INITIALIZING` [status](#pipeline-update-status)
  or terminates, the duration recorded in this metric is calculated by
  subtracting the timestamp of the pipeline log event where the update reached
  the `WAITING_FOR_RESOURCES` [status](#pipeline-update-status) from the
  timestamp of the pipeline log event where the update reached the
  `INITIALIZING` [status](#pipeline-update-status) or terminated.

* `pipeline.update.duration.runTime`

  The `pipeline.update.duration.runTime` metric represents the amount of time
  the update spent actually running, defined as the time the update reached the
  `INITIALIZING` [update status](#pipeline-update-status) until the time the
  update terminates. After the update has reached the `INITIALIZING` [status](#pipeline-update-status)
  but before it terminates, the duration recorded in this metric is the
  "wall clock" time, calculated as the current time when the metric is recorded
  by the integration minus the timestamp of the pipeline log event where the
  update reached the `INITIALIZING` [status](#pipeline-update-status).
  Once the update terminates, the duration recorded in this metric is calculated
  by subtracting the timestamp of the pipeline log event where the update
  reached the `INITIALIZING` [status](#pipeline-update-status) from the
  timestamp of the pipeline log event where the update terminated.

* `pipeline.flow.duration`

  The `pipeline.flow.duration` metric represents the total duration of the flow
  from the time it starts until the time it terminates. After the flow starts
  but before it terminates, the duration recorded in this metric is the
  "wall clock" time, calculated as the current time when the metric is recorded
  by the integration minus the timestamp of the pipeline log event where the
  flow terminated. Once the flow terminates, the duration recorded in this
  metric is calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the pipeline log event
  where the flow started from the timestamp of the pipeline log event where the
  flow terminated.

* `pipeline.flow.duration.queue`

  The `pipeline.flow.duration.queue` metric represents the time the flow spent
  in the queue (that is, while it has the `QUEUED` [flow status](#pipeline-flow-status)).
  While the update in the queue and before it terminates or reaches the
  `PLANNING` or `STARTING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status), the duration
  recorded in this metric is the "wall clock" time, calculated as the current
  time when the metric is recorded by the integration minus the timestamp of the
  pipeline log event where the flow reached the `QUEUED` [status](#pipeline-flow-status).
  Once the flow terminates or reaches either the `PLANNING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status)
  or the `STARTING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status), the duration recorded in
  this metric is calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the pipeline log
  event where the flow reached the `QUEUED` [status](#pipeline-flow-status) from
  the timestamp of the log event where the flow terminated or reached either the
  `PLANNING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status) or the `STARTING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status).

* `pipeline.flow.duration.plan`

  The `pipeline.flow.duration.plan` metric represents the time spent to plan the
  flow (that is, while it has the `PLANNING` [flow status](#pipeline-flow-status)).
  While the update has the `PLANNING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status) and before
  it terminates or reaches the `STARTING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status), the
  duration recorded in this metric is the "wall clock" time, calculated as the
  current time when the metric is recorded by the integration minus the
  timestamp of the pipeline log event where the flow terminated or reached the
  `PLANNING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status). Once the terminates or reaches the
  `STARTING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status), the duration recorded in this
  metric is calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the pipeline log event
  where the flow reached the `PLANNING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status) from the
  timestamp of the log event where the flow terminated or reached the
  `STARTING` [status](#pipeline-flow-status).

**NOTE:** Wall clock durations are _cumulative_, meaning that until the update
or flow reaches the status at which the true duration is calculated, the value
of each successive metric increases monotonically. It is essentially a
[`cumulativeCount` metric](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/cumulative-metrics/)
but stored as a `gauge`. Within [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/)
statements, the [latest()](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
function can be used to get the most recent duration. For example, to show the
most recent duration of flows that are running grouped by flow name, use the
following NRQL (assuming the pipeline update [metricPrefix](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-metricprefix)
is `databricks.`).

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT latest(databricks.pipeline.flow.duration)
WHERE databricksPipelineFlowStatus = `RUNNING`
FACET databricksPipelineFlowName
```

#### Example Pipeline Update Queries

All examples below assume the pipeline update [metricPrefix](#databricks-pipeline-update-metrics-metricprefix)
is `databricks.`.

**Current update counts by state**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT latest(databricks.pipeline.pipelines) AS 'Pipelines'
FACET databricksPipelineState
```

**Current update counts by status**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT latest(databricks.pipeline.updates) AS 'Updates'
FACET databricksPipelineUpdateStatus
```

**Update durations by pipeline name and update ID over time**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT latest(databricks.pipeline.update.duration)
FACET databricksPipelineName, substring(databricksPipelineUpdateId, 0, 6)
TIMESERIES
```

**Recent updates**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT databricksPipelineName AS Pipeline, substring(databricksPipelineUpdateId, 0, 6) AS Update, databricksPipelineUpdateStatus as Status, getField(databricks.pipeline.update.duration, latest) / 1000 AS Duration
WHERE databricks.pipeline.update.duration IS NOT NULL
 AND databricksPipelineUpdateStatus IN ('COMPLETED', 'CANCELED', 'FAILED')
LIMIT MAX
```
**Average update duration by pipeline name and update status**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT average(databricks.pipeline.update.duration) / 1000 AS 'seconds'
WHERE databricksPipelineUpdateStatus IN ('COMPLETED', 'CANCELED', 'FAILED')
FACET databricksPipelineName, databricksPipelineUpdateStatus
TIMESERIES
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to use the condition
`databricksPipelineUpdateStatus IN ('COMPLETED', 'CANCELED', 'FAILED')` when
visualizing or alerting on update duration using [aggregator functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#aggregator-functions)
other than [latest](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest).

**Recent flows**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT databricksPipelineName AS Pipeline, substring(databricksPipelineUpdateId, 0, 6) AS Update, databricksPipelineFlowName AS Flow, databricksPipelineFlowStatus AS Status, getField(databricks.pipeline.flow.duration, latest) / 1000 AS Duration
WHERE databricks.pipeline.flow.duration IS NOT NULL
 AND databricksPipelineFlowStatus IN ('COMPLETED', 'STOPPED', 'SKIPPED', 'FAILED', 'EXCLUDED')
LIMIT MAX
```

**Average flow backlog bytes**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT average(databricks.pipeline.flow.backlogBytes)
FACET databricksPipelineName, databricksPipelineFlowName
```

**Flow expectation records passed**

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT databricksPipelineName AS Pipeline, substring(databricksPipelineUpdateId, 0, 6) AS Update, databricksPipelineFlowName AS Flow, databricksPipelineFlowExpectationName AS Expectation, getField(databricks.pipeline.flow.expectation.recordsPassed, latest) AS Records
WHERE databricks.pipeline.flow.expectation.recordsPassed IS NOT NULL
LIMIT MAX
```

#### Example Pipeline Updates Dashboard

A [sample dashboard](./examples/pipeline-updates-dashboard.json) is included
that shows examples of the types of pipeline update information that can be
displayed and the NRQL statements to use to visualize the data.

![Sample pipeline updates dashboard image](./examples/pipeline-updates-dashboard.png)

### Pipeline Event Logs

The Databricks Integration can collect [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
for all [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/develop-pipelines.html)
defined in a [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
[Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
entries for every [pipeline update](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/updates.html)
are collected and sent to [New Relic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management/).

**NOTE:** Some of the text below is sourced from the
[Databricks Delta Live Tables pipeline event log schema documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-schema)
and the [Databricks SDK Go module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go).

#### Pipeline Event Log Data

[Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
are sent to New Relic as [New Relic Log data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#log-data).
For each [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
entry, the [fields from the event log entry](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-schema)
are mapped to attributes on the corresponding New Relic log entry as follows.

**NOTE:** Due to the way in which the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
returns [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
entries (in descending order by timestamp), later event log entries may
sometimes be visible in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/)
before older event log entries are visible. This does not affect the temporal
ordering of the log entries. Once older log entries become visible (usually
30-60s longer than the value of the [`interval` configuration parameter](#interval)),
they are properly ordered by timestamp in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

### Cluster Health

The [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/introduction-infra-monitoring/)
can be used to collect [infrastructure data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-data/default-infra-data/)
like CPU and memory usage from the nodes in a Databricks [cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
as well as the Spark driver and executor logs, the Spark driver event log, and
the logs from all init scripts on the driver and worker nodes.

#### Installing the New Relic Infrastructure Agent

The [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/introduction-infra-monitoring/)
will be automatically installed on the driver and worker nodes of the cluster
as part of the process of [deploying the integration on the driver node of a cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-the-driver-node-of-a-databricks-cluster)
if the value of the `NEW_RELIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENABLED` environment variable is
set to `true`. In addition, if the value of the environment variable
`NEW_RELIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_LOGS_ENABLED` is set to `true`, the Spark driver and
executor logs, the Spark driver event log, and the logs from all init scripts
on the driver and worker nodes will be collected and [forwarded](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/)
to [New Relic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management/).

#### Cluster Health Data

##### Cluster health infrastructure data

When installed, the [New Relic infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/introduction-infra-monitoring/)
collects [all default infrastructure monitoring data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-data/default-infra-data/)
for the driver and worker nodes. Additionally, a host entity will show up for
each node in the cluster.

##### Cluster health logs

When [log forwarding](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/)
is configured, the following logs are collected.

* Spark driver standard out and standard error logs
* Spark driver [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html) log
* Spark event log
* Standard out and standard error logs for all [init scripts](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/init-scripts/)
  on the driver node
* Spark application executor standard out and standard error logs
* Standard out and standard error logs for all [init scripts](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/init-scripts/)
  on the worker nodes

##### Cluster health attributes

The following attributes are included on all [infrastructure data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-data/default-infra-data/),
all `Log` events collected by the [infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/introduction-infra-monitoring/),
and on the host entities for all nodes in the cluster.

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `databricksWorkspaceHost` | string | The [instance name](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids) of the target Databricks instance |

### Query Metrics

The Databricks Integration can collect telemetry about queries executed in
Databricks SQL warehouses and serverless compute, including execution times,
query statuses, and query I/O metrics such as the number of bytes and rows read
and the number of bytes spilled to disk and sent over the network. This feature
is enabled by default and can be enabled or disabled using the [Databricks query metrics `enabled`](#databricks-query-metrics-enabled)
flag in the [integration configuration](#configuration).

**NOTE:**
* Unlike other metrics collected by the integration, query metrics are only
  recorded once a query has completed execution.
* When [serverless compute](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/serverless/)
  is enabled, metrics for all SQL and Python queries executed on serverless
  compute for notebooks and jobs are returned by the [list query history API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/queryhistory/list)
  used to collect query metrics.
* Some of the text below is sourced from the documentation on
  [Databricks queries](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/user/queries/) and
  the [Databricks SDK Go module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go).

#### Query Metrics `startOffset` Configuration

Query metrics are only collected once when the query terminates, that is, when
it completes successfully, when it fails, or when it is canceled. Furthermore,
query metrics are only collected for queries that terminated since the last
execution of the integration. This way, query metrics are only collected once.

Query metrics are collected using the [query history endpoint](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/user/queries/query-history).
of the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
By default, this endpoint returns queries sorted in descending order by
_start time_. This means that unless the time range used on the [list query history API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/queryhistory/list)
call includes the time when a query started, it will not be returned. Were the
integration to only request the query history since the last execution of the
integration, telemetry for queries that started prior to the last execution of
the integration but completed since the last execution of the integration would
not be recorded because they would not be returned.

To account for this, the integration provides the [`startOffset`](#databricks-query-metrics-startoffset)
configuration parameter. This parameter is used to offset the start time of the
time range used on the [list query history API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/queryhistory/list)
call. The effect of this behavior is that metrics for queries that completed
since the last execution of the integration but started prior to the last
execution of the integration (up to [`startOffset`](#databricks-query-metrics-startoffset)
seconds ago) will be recorded.

For example, consider a query that started 3 minutes prior to the current
execution of the integration but completed 10 seconds prior to the current
execution of the integration. Using the default value of the [`interval`](#interval)
configuration parameter, without a mechanism to effect the start time used to
query the query history, the time range used on [list query history API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/queryhistory/list)
would be 60 seconds ago until 0 seconds ago. Because the [list query history API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/queryhistory/list)
returns queries according to the _start time_ of the query, the example query
would not be returned even though it completed since the last execution of the
integration. Since the query is not returned, the query end time can not be
checked against the time window and the query metrics will never be recorded.

In contrast, with the default [`startOffset`](#databricks-query-metrics-startoffset)
(600 seconds or 10 minutes), the example query would be returned even though it
started before the last execution of the integration. Since the query is
returned, the integration will see that the query completed since the last
execution of the integration, and will record the query metrics for the query.

**NOTE:**
It is important to carefully select a value for the [`startOffset`](#databricks-query-metrics-startoffset)
configuration parameter. Collecting query metrics with the [list query history API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/queryhistory/list)
is an expensive operation. A value should be chosen that accounts for as many
long running queries as possible without negatively affecting the performance
of the integration or the cost of executing the [list query history API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/queryhistory/list)
call.

#### Query Metrics `intervalOffset` Configuration

Since query metrics are only collected if the query terminated since the last
execution of the integration, if there is any lag setting the query end time,
it is possible for some queries to be missed. For example, consider a query that
ends one second prior to the current run time of the integration. If the end
time of the query takes one second or more to be reflected in the API, the query
end time will not be set during the current run of the integration and can not
be checked. On the subsequent run of the integration, the query will be returned
and it's end time will be set but the end time will fall just outside the last
run time of the integration. As such, the metrics for the query will never be
recorded.

To account for this, the integration provides the [`intervalOffset`](#databricks-query-metrics-intervaloffset)
configuration parameter. This parameter is used to slide the time window that
the query end time is checked against by some number of seconds, allowing the
query end time additional time to be reflected in the API. The default value for
the [`intervalOffset`](#databricks-query-metrics-intervaloffset) configuration
parameter is 5 seconds.

#### Query Metric Data

Query metric data is sent to New Relic as [events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data).
The following event attributes are provided.

### Coding Conventions

#### Style Guidelines

While not strictly enforced, the basic preferred editor settings are set in the
[.editorconfig](./.editorconfig). Other than this, no style guidelines are
currently imposed.

#### Static Analysis

This project uses both [`go vet`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet) and
[`staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.io/) to perform static code analysis. These
checks are run via [`precommit`](https://pre-commit.com) on all commits. Though
this can be bypassed on local commit, both tasks are also run during
[the `validate` workflow](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) and must have no
errors in order to be merged.

#### Commit Messages

Commit messages must follow [the conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Again, while this can be bypassed on local commit, it is strictly enforced in
[the `validate` workflow](./.github/workflows/validate.yml).

The basic commit message structure is as follows.

```
<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

In addition to providing consistency, the commit message is used by
[svu](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) during
[the release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml). The presence and values
of certain elements within the commit message affect auto-versioning. For
example, the `feat` type will bump the minor version. Therefore, it is important
to use the guidelines below and carefully consider the content of the commit
message.

Please use one of the types below.

- `feat` (bumps minor version)
- `fix` (bumps patch version)
- `chore`
- `build`
- `docs`
- `test`

Any type can be followed by the `!` character to indicate a breaking change.
Additionally, any commit that has the text `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer will
indicate a breaking change.

### Local Development

For local development, simply use `go build` and `go run`. For example,

```bash
go build cmd/databricks/databricks.go
```

Or

```bash
go run cmd/databricks/databricks.go
```

If you prefer, you can also use [`goreleaser`](https://goreleaser.com/) with
the `--single-target` option to build the binary for the local `GOOS` and
`GOARCH` only.

```bash
goreleaser build --single-target
```

### Releases

Releases are built and packaged using [`goreleaser`](https://goreleaser.com/).
By default, a new release will be built automatically on any push to the `main`
branch. For more details, review the [`.goreleaser.yaml`](./.goreleaser.yaml)
and [the `goreleaser` documentation](https://goreleaser.com/intro/).

The [svu](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) utility is used to generate the next
tag value [based on commit messages](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu#commit-messages-vs-what-they-do).

### GitHub Workflows

This project utilizes GitHub workflows to perform actions in response to
certain GitHub events.

| Workflow | Events | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| [validate](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) | `push`, `pull_request` to `main` branch | Runs [precommit](https://pre-commit.com) to perform static analysis and runs [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to validate the last commit message |
| [build](./.github/workflows/build.yml) | `push`, `pull_request` | Builds and tests code |
| [release](./.github/workflows/release.yml) | `push` to `main` branch | Generates a new tag using [svu](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) and runs [`goreleaser`](https://goreleaser.com/) |
| [repolinter](./.github/workflows/repolinter.yml) | `pull_request` | Enforces repository content guidelines |

## Appendix

### Example: Creating and Using a Secret for your New Relic License Key

Sensitive data like credentials and API keys should never be specified directly
in custom [environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/configure#environment-variables).
Instead, it is recommended to create a [secret](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html)
using the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/index.html)
and [reference the secret in the environment variable](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/secrets/secrets-spark-conf-env-var#reference-a-secret-in-an-environment-variable).

For example, the [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) used to
install the Databricks Integration when [deploying the integration on the driver node of a cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-the-driver-node-of-a-databricks-cluster)
requires the New Relic license key to be specified in the environment variable
named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`. The steps below show an example of how to create
a secret for the New Relic license key and [reference it in a custom environment variable](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/secrets/secrets-spark-conf-env-var#reference-a-secret-in-an-environment-variable).

1. Follow the steps to [install or update the Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html).
1. Use the Databricks CLI to create a [Databricks-backed secret scope](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secret-scopes.html#create-a-databricks-backed-secret-scope)
   with the name `newrelic`. For example,

   ```bash
   databricks secrets create-scope newrelic
   ```

   **NOTE:** Be sure to take note of the information in the referenced URL about
   the `MANAGE` scope permission and use the correct version of the command.
1. Use the Databricks CLI to create a secret for the license key in the new
   scope with the name `licenseKey`. For example,

   ```bash
   databricks secrets put-secret --json '{
      "scope": "newrelic",
      "key": "licenseKey",
      "string_value": "[YOUR_LICENSE_KEY]"
   }'
   ```

To set the custom environment variable named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` and
reference the value from the secret, follow the steps to
[configure custom environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#environment-variables)
and add the following line after the last entry in the `Environment variables`
field.

`NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY={{secrets/newrelic/licenseKey}}`
